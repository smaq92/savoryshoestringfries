            <h2>Shoestring Fries: The Untold Story</h2>
            <p>Having grown up in a tropical country, the Philippines, fries have been a luxury food that we eat
                occasionally. We can only get it through fast-food chains at either Jollibee or McDonald’s. When I
                immigrated to Canada, my entire world changed. One can buy processed French fries at the grocery stores,
                and suddenly I’m in a French fry heaven. I was dumbstruck when I found out that there were about thirty
                distinct types of fries. I didn’t realize that the fries I have been munching off my go-to McDonald’s
                restaurant are called “shoestring fries.” Shoestring is the slightly Ozempic version of the traditional
                French fires. It is thinner, crispier, and easier to cook! My world got turned upside down and I am not
                going back. </p>

                    <h3>ORIGIN: All about the “slightly Ozempic” French Fries </h3>
                    <p>The shoestring fries, also known as matchstick fries is what I call the Ozempic French Fries.
                        They
                        are thinner and crispier. They can get traced back to the late 19th or early 20th century,
                        alongside
                        the rise of fast food and quick-serve meals. The creator however is still being debated up to
                        this
                        day. Shoestring fries still became a hit and the secret to that is because of their thin cuts,
                        their
                        thin slices allow a larger part of the fries to be fried hence crunchier. It still remains to be
                        a
                        beloved snack or side dish up to this day.</p>

                        <p>I’m not really a cook person, I’m more into baking but shoestring fries is just so easy and
                            fast to make that I always find myself craving and cooking it. You only need 3 ingredients:
                            potato, salt and oil. First, wash and peel the potato and soak it in cold water for half an
                            hour, drain and pat dry like you mean it. You then preheat the deep fryer or a large pot to
                            375°F (190°C), you can check this via thermometer or dipping a wooden spoon and look for
                            bubbles around the wood. Fry it till golden brown. Remove with a strainer and drain on paper
                            towels. And sprinkle at once with your magic salt or your favorite spices. Voila! You can
                            now enjoy your hot and crispy shoestring fries!</p>

                        <p>Despite its name, shoestring fries can’t be found in a shoe section let alone the shoe store.
                            But fret not, I got you! They can actually be found in a variety of places, from fast-food
                            chains to upscale restaurants. Many burger joints and diners, such as Five Guys or Shake
                            Shack, offer them as a crispy side choice. The McDonald fries that we all come to love?
                            That’s also shoestring fries! They’re also popular in gastropubs, paired with gourmet
                            burgers or steaks. The next time you do your groceries, try and check the variety of

                    <h3>To shoe or to string, that is the question</h3>
                    <p>I know I’m like a broken record for saying once again that shoestring’s thinner and crispier than
                        traditional fries. But did you know those same qualities makes them a powerhouse when it comes
                        to
                        versatility? They can be used in a lot of ways. In fact, they actually play an interesting role
                        in
                        the food war between gourmet cooks and fast food chains. You can see them in loaded fries or can
                        even be stacked into fry stacks. Furthermore, their thinness makes them an ideal medium for
                        inventive spice mixtures like smoky paprika or truffle salt, which turns a basic fry to a
                        gourmet
                        dish. So, what I’m saying is, why pick between fast food and gourmet when you can have both?
